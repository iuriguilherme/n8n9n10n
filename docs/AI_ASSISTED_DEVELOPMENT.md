**AI-Assisted Development Log**

This file documents the changes made during an AI-assisted editing session. It is intended as a concise record for maintainers and auditors. Sensitive values (API keys, tokens, passwords) are not included here — they remain in the local `./.env` and should not be committed.

**Summary**
- **Session date**: 2025-11-14
- **Scope**: Docker Compose / environment variables / n8n workflow updates / cleanup of local Dockerfile / documentation updates

**Files Added / Modified / Removed**
- **Updated**: `docker-compose.yml`
  - Replaced inline `environment:` blocks for `postgres` and `n8n` with `env_file: - .env` to centralize configuration.
  - Switched the `n8n` service from a local build to the official image: `image: n8nio/n8n:1.120.2`.
  - Kept `depends_on`, `volumes`, `ports`, and `healthcheck` as before.

- **Added**: `./.env`
  - Created a single environment file that contains runtime variables and placeholders for secrets (Postgres, n8n, Telegram tokens, OpenAI/Gemini/Deepseek credentials, LLM provider selection, fallback provider/model, n8n runtime flags, timezone and NODE_ENV).
  - IMPORTANT: This file contains secrets for local development. Do not commit it to source control; add it to `.gitignore`.

- **Updated**: `./.env.example`
  - Expanded to document all environment variables used by the compose setup, including `POSTGRES_*`, `DB_*`, `N8N_*`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and provider-specific variables (`GEMINI_*`, `DEEPSEEK_*`), `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, and fallback variables.

- **Updated**: `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
  - Replaced prior minimal env instructions with updated guidance to copy `./.env.example` to `.env`, fill provider keys, and the new LLM provider/fallback options.

- **Removed**: `Dockerfile`
  - The local `Dockerfile` was removed from the project because the compose file uses the official image now.
  - The deletion was committed locally using the repository's inferred GitHub identity.

- **Updated**: `workflows/telegram-multi-agent-bot.json`
  - Added a new `Code` node named **Set LLM Provider Info** which attaches `llm_provider`, `llm_model`, and fallback fields from environment variables to each item.
  - Updated the `LLM Generate Response` node to use the environment model: `={{$env.LLM_MODEL}}` instead of a hard-coded model string.
  - Updated the `Store Agent Response` SQL to record the model used via `{{$env.LLM_MODEL}}`.
  - Routed the flow so conversation context goes through `Set LLM Provider Info` before calling the LLM node.

- **Removed**: `Dockerfile` commit
  - A local commit was made removing the Dockerfile (not pushed to remote).

**New environment variables introduced**
- `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL` — choose provider and model (e.g., `openai`, `gemini`, `deepseek`).
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_BASE` — optional Gemini credentials.
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_BASE` — optional Deepseek credentials.
- `FALLBACK_LLM_PROVIDER`, `FALLBACK_LLM_MODEL` — provider/model to try when the primary fails.
- `N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS`, `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED`, `NODE_ENV`, `GENERIC_TIMEZONE`, `TZ` — n8n runtime flags and timezone settings.

**Commands run during session**
- `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml config` — validate merged compose config several times.
- `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml up -d` — started services locally (as requested earlier in the session).
- `git remote get-url origin` — infer GitHub username for local commit identity.
- `git config user.name "<inferred>"` and `git config user.email "<inferred>@users.noreply.github.com"` — set local git identity for this repository.
- `git rm -f Dockerfile` and `git commit -m "chore: remove local Dockerfile (use official n8n image)"` — remove Dockerfile and commit deletion locally.

**Validation & Notes**
- `docker-compose config` reported a warning that the `version` field is deprecated. Consider removing the `version: '3.8'` line from `docker-compose.yml` to silence the warning.
- The `.env` file now contains secret values (tokens, API keys). Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if you haven't already.
- I did not push commits to remote; confirm if you want me to push them.

**Recommended next steps**
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.
- Remove the deprecated `version` line from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Implement runtime provider-fallback logic in the n8n workflow:
  - Option A: Use a `Code` or HTTP node that attempts the primary provider and, on failure, calls the fallback provider using provider-specific env vars. This is the most flexible path.
  - Option B: Create separate provider nodes (OpenAI/Gemini/Deepseek) and use conditional branching based on `LLM_PROVIDER`.
- Optionally add `docker-compose.override.yml` for local development that sets `build: .` to use a local Dockerfile when needed (keeping the main compose file referencing the stable image for production).

**Where to look**
- `docker-compose.yml` — main compose definition (now uses `env_file` and official n8n image).
- `./.env` — local runtime environment (contains secrets; not to be committed).
- `./.env.example` — template and documentation of env vars.
`docs/QUICKSTART.md` — updated setup instructions.
- `workflows/telegram-multi-agent-bot.json` — workflow changes for LLM provider/fallback flags.

If you want, I can:
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` now and commit that change.
- Remove the `version` line from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Implement the provider-fallback logic inside the n8n workflow (Code + HTTP nodes) and test the flow.

### 2025-11-14  AI Append: docs reorganization & cleanup (preserve history)

- Moved top-level documentation files into `docs/` and updated internal references:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and this file were moved to `docs/`.
  - Updated `docs/AI_ASSISTED_DEVELOPMENT.md` to reference `docs/QUICKSTART.md`.

- Updated `README.md`:
  - Added a **Documentation** section linking the moved docs under `docs/`.
  - Added a **License** section pointing to `LICENSE` and noting GPLv3.

- Inspected `scripts/import-and-run.sh`:
  - Located a POSIX shell import script at `scripts/import-and-run.sh`.
  - Performed a repo-wide search: there are no references to this script in the codebase.
  - Attempted removal via git earlier but the removal was not committed; the file remains on disk.
  - I did not delete the file without explicit confirmation. If you want it removed I can delete the file from disk and/or run `git rm` and commit the removal.

This entry is appended to preserve the full history of AI-assisted edits. I will not modify earlier entries  only append new ones as requested.

### 2025-11-14  AI Append: moved docker files, removed compose version, and commit

- Removed top-level `version` key from `docker-compose.yml` to silence the compose deprecation warning.
- Created `docker/` and moved `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.js`, and `init.sql` into it; updated `docker-compose.yml` to use `./docker/init.sql` and `build: ./docker`.
- Removed root copies of the moved files.
- Validated `docker-compose` config; services reported: `postgres`, `n8n`.
- Appended this entry to `docs/AI_ASSISTED_DEVELOPMENT.md` and committed changes locally. The branch is ahead of `origin/main` by one commit; run `git push origin main` to publish.
